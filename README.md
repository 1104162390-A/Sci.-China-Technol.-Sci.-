## Abstract
Soft electronics are well-suited for wearable systems due to their ability to conform to the human body. However, most existing designs are built for specific tasks and lack flexibility for reuse or expansion. Here, we develop a modular soft-electronic platform that connects sensing, control, actuation, and power modules through a flexible version of the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Each module has a defined function and can be added, removed, or replaced without changing the rest of the system. We apply the platform in two representative scenarios: a static pressure-mapping insole and a dynamic limb-mounted motion recognition system. The insole integrates a 32-channel pressure sensor grid for high-resolution plantar load monitoring during postural tasks. When adhered onto the thigh and/or shank, the system leverages inertial sensing and an onboard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify seven daily activities with real-time feedback. These demonstrations showcase the platform’s adaptability across static and dynamic use cases, offering a solution toward reconfigurable, intelligent soft electronics for wearable and interactive applications.
